My C library learning project
-----------------------------

That's right, I'm brushing up on my C. I've been programming Web applications (and having a lot of fun with it) for about 12 years. Now I have a shiny new job where C is the language of choice. I need to brush up, and fast. This is my way of learning.

This is _not_, however, intended to be a bit of sample code in a hello-world scenario. As I said, I have been developing production-quality web software for 12 years. I understand the paradigms of web development and the challenges encountered in that environment. I am undertaking this project to help me translate that experience to the technology I now have to work with. This is intended to be production-quality code.

### What you will find here
You will find my attempt at a functional and useful web-based library in C.

### What you will _not_ find here
You will not find a comprehensive and exhaustive implementation of HTTP or CGI. I will implement features as I encounter them in my development.

### Web Standards
I will do my best to stick to established web standards when I can (and where I can find them). I am not terribly familiar with all of the HTTP standards - many of the environments I worked in previously abstracted them for me.
